# Storyboard reference

## What is the problem
The common pattern for instantiating view controllers from storyboard in code is not cool ðŸ˜Ž. We usually need to hardcode storyboard ID and force cast to the right type. If we have multiple storyboards, we need to hardcode their names too. We end up with something like this

```swift
let userProfile = UIStoryboard(name: "User", bundle: nil).instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("UserProfileViewControllerID") as! UserProfileViewController
```

Well, we can do better. How about something like this

```swift
let userProfile = Storyboard.User.ProfileVC.instantiate()
```

## How can we do this?

We create our own Storyboard reference. First, we need to define our storyboard type, which will be a foundation for the definition of our storyboards.

```swift
protocol StoryboardType {
    static var name: String { get }
}
```
Simple as that - storyboads have to have a name. Now we need storyboard reference to a view controller. It should specify in which storyboard the controller lies, what is its ID and what type should it be.

```swift
struct StoryboardReference<S: StoryboardType, T> {
    let id: String
}
```
where `S` is our storyboard type, `T` is controller type and `id` is our storyboard ID. Now we have all we need to create the `instantiate()` function.

```swift
struct StoryboardReference<S: StoryboardType, T> {
    let id: String
    
    func instantiate() -> T {
        return UIStoryboard(name: S.name, bundle: nil).instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(id) as! T
    }
}
```

And finally we define our storyboards

```swift
struct Storyboard {

    struct User: StoryboardType {
        static let name: String = "User"
        
        static let ProfileVC = StoryboardReference<User, UserProfileViewController>(id: "UserProfileViewControllerID")
        static let SettingVC = StoryboardReference<User, UserSettingsViewController>(id: "UserSettingsViewControllerID")
    }
    
    struct Main: StoryboardType {
        static let name: String = "Main"
        
        static let Root = StoryboardReference<Main, RootViewController>(id:"RootViewControllerID")
    }
}
```

We defined 2 storyboards and 3 view controllers. Now we can use it

```swift
let rootViewController = Storyboard.Main.Root.instantiate()
window.rootViewController = rootViewController
```

Cool ðŸ˜Ž
